Python makes performing file I/O simple. Take a look
at how to read and write to files here:

# Open up the "foo.txt" file (which already exists) for reading
# Print all the contents of the file, then close the file

# YOUR CODE HERE
with open('foo.txt') as foo:
	read_data = foo.read()
	print(read_data)

# Open up a file called "bar.txt" (which doesn't exist yet) for
# writing. Write three lines of arbitrary content to that file,
# then close the file. Open up "bar.txt" and inspect it to make
# sure that it contains what you expect it to contain

# YOUR CODE HERE
with open('bar.txt', 'r+') as bar:
	write_data = "a thistle a whistle a flitter a pop"
	bar.write(write_data)
	read_data = bar.read()
	print(read_data)
